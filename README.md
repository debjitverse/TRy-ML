# 🏡 House Price Prediction Web App

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts house prices based on key features like quality, living area, garage capacity, and basement size. This project integrates **Python**, **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, and **scikit-learn**, making it a perfect blend of **data science** and **web development**.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 💡 **Trained ML Model**: Predicts house prices using a `RandomForestRegressor`.
- 🌐 **Frontend**: Responsive and modern UI built with **HTML5** and **CSS3**.
- ⚙️ **Backend**: Flask-based server processes input and displays predictions.
- 🧠 **Features Used**:
  - `OverallQual`: Overall material and finish quality
  - `GrLivArea`: Above-ground living area (sqft)
  - `GarageCars`: Number of cars that can fit in the garage
  - `TotalBsmtSF`: Total basement area (sqft)
